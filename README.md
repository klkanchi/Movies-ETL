## Extract, Transform, Load

### Purpose

1. Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.

2. Extract data from disparate sources using Python.

3. Clean and transform data using Pandas.

4. Use regular expressions (Regex) to parse data and to transform text into numbers.

5. Load data with PostgreSQL and verify in PgAdmin.

6. The project included extracting a large data set from Kaggle, then transforming the data into a usable dataset for a "hacking competition." Once the data was transformed and narrowed in scope for the hack-a-thon, the DataFrames were loaded into PostgresSQL.
